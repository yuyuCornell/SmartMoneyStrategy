## Overview
Abstract
This project focuses on exploring the application of machine learning and reinforcement learning models in developing effective trading strategies using 13F data. The study involves tracking
the holdings of major fund managers through 13F data and utilizing predictive models to generate insights for trading decisions. By analyzing the data through these models, the project aims
to provide new insights into the development of successful trading strategies in the financial
markets.

## Approach
We build this project with feature engineering, Machine learning (Keamns, PCA, Ridge Regression), and TD3 in Reinforcement Learning.
