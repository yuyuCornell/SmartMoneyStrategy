# SmartMoneyStrategy
ORIE 5741 WeTeam21: Yu Zhang and Yijia Gao

## Overview
This project explores the 13F filings required by SEC after 2013-6.

The 13F data shows us a way to leverage successful fund managers' ideas, but we keep the liquidity better.

## Approach
We build this project with feature engineering, Machine learning (Keamns, PCA, Ridge Regression), and TD3 in Reinforcement Learning.
